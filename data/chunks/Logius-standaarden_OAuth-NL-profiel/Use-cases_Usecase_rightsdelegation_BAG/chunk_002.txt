##Overview
Key registries in Dutch government often have a single registry where all data is collected but multiple source holders are responsible for maintaining parts of the data.  Source holders, such as municipalities, should not be allowed to modify each others data without permission. It is very common to either have commercial cloud providers or partnerships of cooperating municipalities maintain a key registry on behalf of multiple sourceholders. Currently Dutch Cadastre hosts multiple key registries where this is the case each with its own application level solution to allow for this. Within the key registry adresses and buildings a PoC has been executed to show how OAuth can solve this in a generic way. This has the advantage of cutting down on custom code and affering a uniform procedure to source holders who often maintain multiple key registries at Dutch Cadastre.
