##Rationale

To mitigate the risk of incorrect data or manipulation of sensor data the sensor will connect to the authorization server first while onboarding (Step 1). The authorization server checks the provided sensor ID and provides the sensor with a token (Step 2). The sensor then starts to collect data and upload the data to the provided API and includes the token with each request to the resource server.
