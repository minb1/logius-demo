General Rationale

The reason for the creation of iGov-NL is an advisory document on the adoption of OAuth as a mandatory(comply or explain) standard for the Dutch public sector. It states that a Dutch profile is needed for the OAuth standard to avoid interoperability problems between different implementations. The existance of iGov-NL has become a precondition for the adaoption of OAuth as mandatory standard for the Dutch public sector.
