9 Embedding certificates

The party offering the JWT token has a choice to either include an embedded certificate chain (<code>x5c</code>) or include a url that points to the certificate chain (<code>x5u</code>). 
Parties receiving and validating JWT tokens may need to be able to support both <code>x5c</code> and <code>x5u</code>. 
The choice between <code>x5c</code> and <code>x5u</code> entails a trade-off. Including the certificate chain in JWT tokens makes for longer tokens (around 1kB for tokens with url, versus around 5kB for tokens with a single embedded certificate). 
Also, having the certificates accessible over URLs creates the possibility of establishing the necessary PKI infrastructure for encrypted message exchange. 
However, certificates accessible by url introduce (possibly undesired) run-time dependence on an on-line resource. Also, detecting and supporting both options makes for more complex token validation logic.
