2.3.1 Requests to the Authorization Endpoint
iGov-NL

Native clients MUST apply PKCE, as per RFC7636. As code_verifier the S256 method MUST be applied. Effectively this means that a Native Client MUST include a cryptographic random code_challenge of at least 128 bits of entropy and the code_challenge_method with the value S256.

Request fields:

client_id
Mandatory. MUST have the value as obtained during registration.
scope
Optional.
response_type
Mandatory. MUST have value `code` for the Authorization Code Flow.
redirect_uri
Mandatory. MUST be an absolute HTTPS URL, pre-registered with the Authorization Server.
state
Mandatory, see above. Do not use the SessionID secure cookie for this.
code_challenge
In case of using a native app as user-agent mandatory. (Eg. an UUID [rfc4122])
code_challenge_method
In case `code_challenge` is used with a native app, mandatory. MUST use the value `S256`.
