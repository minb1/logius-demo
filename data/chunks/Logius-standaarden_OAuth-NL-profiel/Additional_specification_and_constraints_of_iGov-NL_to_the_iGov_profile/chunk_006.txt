2.3.4 Client Keys

iGov-NL

In case the Authorization Server, Resource Server and client are not operated under responsibility of the same organisation, each party MUST use PKIoverheid certificates with OIN.
The PKIoverheid certificate MUST be included either as a <code>x5c</code> or as <code>x5u</code> parameter, as per [[rfc7517]] ยง4.6 and 4.7. Parties SHOULD at least support the inclusion of the certificate as <code>x5c</code> parameter, for maximum interoperability. 
Parties MAY agree to use <code>x5u</code>, for instance for communication within specific environments.
