Based on international iGov standard
This profile is based upon the international government assurance profile for OAuth 2.0 (iGov) [iGOV.OAuth2] as published by the OpenID Foundation (https://openid.net/foundation/). It should be considered a fork of this profile as the iGov profile is geared more towards the American situtation and in the Netherlands we have to deal with an European Union context.
We have added the chapter Usecases to illustrate the specific usecase the iGov-NL profile is aimed at.  
Besides the OAuth profile iGov also has a complementary OpenID connect profile [iGOV.OpenID]. If and when OpenID connect becomes a mandatory standard for the Dutch public sector iGov-NL can be expanded with a Dutch version of the iGov OpenID Connect profile. De usecase described at the beginning of iGov-NL was written with this possible expansion in mind.
