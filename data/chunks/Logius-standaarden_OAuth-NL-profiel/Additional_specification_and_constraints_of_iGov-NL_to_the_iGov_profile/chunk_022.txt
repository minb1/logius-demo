1 Use of local infrastructure for PKI certificates (PKIOverheid)
The Dutch government has its own infrastructure for PKI certificates based on international open standards(x509 etc...). Its implementation is based on Dutch laws. It allows for a uniform way of identifying organizations based on the OIN identifier included in the certificate and then authenticating an authorizing them. This reduces the complexity of maintainging authorization tables for service providers, as these can be based directly on OIN identifiers. Using PKI certficates allows service consumers to re-use their existing PKIOverheid certificates instead of burdening them with maintaining yet another authentication product.
