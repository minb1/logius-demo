2.3.3 Requests to the Token Endpoint
iGov-NL

In addition to above signing methods, the Authorization server SHOULD support PS256 signing algorithm [RFC7518] for the signing of the private_key_jwt.

Effectively, the Token Request has the following content:

grant_type
Mandatory. MUST contain the value `authorization_code`
code
Mandatory. MUST be the value obtained from the Authorization Response.
scope
Optional. MUST be less or same as the requested scope.
redirect_uri
Mandatory. MUST be an absolute HTTPS URL, pre-registered with the Authorization Server.
client_id
Mandatory. MUST have the value as obtained during registration.
client_assertion_type
Mandatory. MUST have the value `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`, properly encoded.
client_assertion
Mandatory. MUST have the above specified signed JWT as contents.
