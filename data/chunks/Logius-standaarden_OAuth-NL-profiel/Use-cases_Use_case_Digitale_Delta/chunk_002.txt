##Overview

The Digitale Delta API provides access to measurements and related information.
It is not an specific implementation of an API, but a template that defines its behaviour and its resources.

Consumers of the data, in general, will be automated processes or systems such as Business Intelligence or GIS systems.
Since not all data may be open or public, access to certain data must be restricted.
However, also browser based solutions, or Excel users, can be consumers of the data.

For automated requests, interactive scenario's are no feasible. A certificate scenario may not be feasible either.

Next to cunsuming data, the API allows for adding or removing data by using import files or sensor devices.

This also is (mostly) an automated proces. The same situation applies: interactive scenario's may not be usable, and PKI certificates may not be able to be deployed on sensory devices.

The addition to the Authorization Code Flow, the Client Credential Flow can be used to cover the scenario's.
