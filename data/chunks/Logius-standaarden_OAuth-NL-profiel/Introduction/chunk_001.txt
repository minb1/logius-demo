##Introduction

This document profiles the OAuth 2.0 web authorization framework for use in the context of securing web-facing application programming interfaces (APIs), particularly Representational State Transfer (RESTful) APIs. The OAuth 2.0 specifications accommodate a wide range of implementations with varying security and usability considerations, across different types of software clients. The OAuth 2.0 client, protected resource, and authorization server profiles defined in this document serve two purposes:

1.  Define a mandatory baseline set of security controls suitable for a wide range of government use cases, while maintaining reasonable ease of implementation and functionality
2.  Identify optional, advanced security controls for sensitive use cases where increased risk justifies more stringent controls.

This OAuth profile is intended to be shared broadly, and has been ~~greatly influenced by the [HEART OAuth2 Profile][[HEART.OAuth2]].~~ derived from the [iGov OAuth2 profile] [[iGOV.OAuth2]].
