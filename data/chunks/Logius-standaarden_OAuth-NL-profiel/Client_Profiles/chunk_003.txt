####Full Client with User Delegation

This client type applies to clients that act on behalf of a particular resource owner and require delegation of that user’s authority to access the protected resource. Furthermore, these clients are capable of interacting with a separate web browser application to facilitate the resource owner's interaction with the authentication endpoint of the authorization server.

These clients MUST use the authorization code flow of OAuth 2 by sending the resource owner to the authorization endpoint to obtain authorization. The user MUST authenticate to the authorization endpoint. The user’s web browser is then redirected back to a URI hosted by the client service, from which the client can obtain an authorization code passed as a query parameter. The client then presents that authorization code along with its own credentials (`private_key_jwt`) to the authorization server's token endpoint to obtain an access token.

These clients MUST be associated with a unique public key, as described in [Section 2.3.4](#client-keys).

This client type MAY request and be issued a refresh token if the security parameters of the access request allow for it.
