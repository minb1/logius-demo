####Redirect URI

Clients using the authorization code grant type MUST register their full redirect URIs. The Authorization Server MUST validate the redirect URI given by the client at the authorization endpoint using strict string comparison.

A client MUST protect the values passed back to its redirect URI by ensuring that the redirect URI is one of the following:

*   Hosted on a website with Transport Layer Security (TLS) protection (a Hypertext Transfer Protocol â€“ Secure (HTTPS) URI)
*   Hosted on a client-specific non-remote-protocol URI scheme (e.g., `myapp://`)
*   Hosted on the local domain of the client (e.g., `http://localhost/`).

Clients MUST NOT allow the redirecting to the local domain.

Clients SHOULD NOT have multiple redirect URIs on different domains.

Clients MUST NOT forward values passed back to their redirect URIs to other arbitrary or user-provided URIs (a practice known as an "open redirector").
