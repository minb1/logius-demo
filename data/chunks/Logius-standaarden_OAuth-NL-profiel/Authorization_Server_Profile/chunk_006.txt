####Client Approval

When prompting the end user with an interactive approval page, the authorization server MUST indicate to the user:

*   Whether the client was dynamically registered, or else statically registered by a trusted administrator, or a public client.
*   Whether the client is associated with a software statement, and in which case provide information about the trusted issuer of the software statement.
*   What kind of access the client is requesting, including scope, protected resources (if applicable beyond scopes), and access duration.

For example, for native clients a message indicating a new App installation has been registered as a client can help users determine if this is the expected behaviour. This signal helps users protect themselves from potentially rogue clients.
