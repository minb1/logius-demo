####RefreshTokens

Authorization Servers MAY issue refresh tokens to clients under the following context:

Clients MUST be registered with the Authorization Server.

Clients MUST present a valid client_id. Confidential clients MUST present a signed client_assertion with their associated keypair.

Clients using the Direct Credentials method MUST NOT be issued refresh_tokens. These clients MUST present their client credentials with a new access_token request and the desired scope.
