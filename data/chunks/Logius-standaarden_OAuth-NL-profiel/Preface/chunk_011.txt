##Use case: Authorization code flow

In this use case a (public/governmental) service is offered via an API.
The service will be consumed by the User using a client, that can be any arbitrary, non-trusted application.
For provisioning the service, the service provider requires an identifier of the User.
The identifier of the User can be either an arbitrary (self-registered) identifier or a formal identifier (citizen number or other restricted, registered ID).
Upon service provisioning, the service uses the identifier of the User for access control within the service.

A Client wishes to send a request to an API, on behalf of the User.
The API requires to have a trusted identification and *authorization* of the User, before providing the Service.
A Client has pre-registered with the Authorization Endpoint and has been assigned a client_id.
