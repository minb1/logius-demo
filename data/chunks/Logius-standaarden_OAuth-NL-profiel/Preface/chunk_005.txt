###Authorization Server

An Authorization Server is available, operated by either an independent trusted third-party or the service provider itself.
Only a single Authorization Server is in use.
The Authorization Server is trusted by the Resource Server.
The Authorization Server can identify and authorize the User.
In case the User has no direct relationship to the Authorization Server, it can forward the User to an IDP trusted by both the Authorization Server as well as the User.
Alternatively, the Authorization Server can otherwise identify and authorize the User and is trusted by that User.
