###Client

The User uses a client, which can be any arbitrary application decided upon by the User.
Assumed is that the User trusts this client for interaction with the service.
The authorization server has at least low trust in the client when the client is either public or semi-confidential.
Assumptions is that the Client is aware of the specifications of the API and authorization is required.
The Client is either using a user-agent, typically a browser, or the relevant parts are integrated into the Client application.

Note:
Web-applications by default use the system-browser on a User's device as user-agent.
Typically a native application (_"mobile app"_) either starts a system browser as user-agent or uses an _in-app_ browser.
See RFC 8252 for more information on implementation of native applications.
Clients can also be 'machine clients' types.
