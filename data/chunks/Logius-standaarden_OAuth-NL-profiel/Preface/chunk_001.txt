##Dutch government Assurance profile for OAuth 2.0

This profile is based upon the [[[iGOV.OAuth2]]] as published
by the OpenID Foundation (https://openid.net/foundation/). It should be considered a fork of this profile as the iGov profile is geared more towards the American situation and in the Netherlands we have to deal with an European Union context. 

We have added the chapter [Use cases](#usecases) to illustrate the specific use case the iGov-NL profile is aimed at. Starting with chapter [Introduction](#introduction) we follow the structure of the iGov profile. Where we do not use content from iGov we use ~~strikethrough~~ to indicate it is not part of iGov-NL.
