###Step 3. User Authorization and consent

The Authorization Server identifies the Resource Owner (often, but not necessarily, the User) and obtains authorization and consent from the Resource Owner for using the client to access the Service.
The method and means for identification, as well as how to obtain authorization and consent from the Resource Owner for the request, are implementation specific and explicitly left out of scope of this profile.
Note that if the User and Resource Owner are one and the same, the Autorization Server will have to authenticate the User in order to reliably identify the User as Resource Owner before obtaining the authorization and consent.
