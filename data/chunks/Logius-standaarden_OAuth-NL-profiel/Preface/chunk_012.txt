###Step 1. Authorization initiation

As the client does not yet have a (valid) access token for this Service, it's first step is to obtain one.

It does so by redirecting / initiating the user-agent with the Authorization Request to the Authorization Endpoint.
The Authorization request holds further details, as specified in this profile.
