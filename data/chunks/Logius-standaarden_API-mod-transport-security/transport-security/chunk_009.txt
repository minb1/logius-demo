###Validate content types
A REST request or response body SHOULD match the intended content type in the header. Otherwise this could cause misinterpretation at the consumer/producer side and lead to code injection/execution.

- Reject requests containing unexpected or missing content type headers with HTTP response status `406 Unacceptable` or `415 Unsupported Media Type`.
- Avoid accidentally exposing unintended content types by explicitly defining content types e.g. Jersey (Java) `@consumes("application/json"); @produces("application/json")`. This avoids XXE-attack vectors for example.

It is common for REST services to allow multiple response types (e.g. `application/xml` or `application/json`, and the client specifies the preferred order of response types by the Accept header in the request.
- Do NOT simply copy the `Accept` header to the `Content-type` header of the response.
- Reject the request (ideally with a `406 Not Acceptable` response) if the Accept header does not specifically contain one of the allowable types.

Services (potentially) including script code (e.g. JavaScript) in their responses MUST be especially careful to defend against header injection attack.
- Ensure sending intended content type headers in your response matching your body content e.g. `application/json` and not `application/javascript`.
