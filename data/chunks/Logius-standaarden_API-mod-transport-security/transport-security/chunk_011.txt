###HTTP header filtering
Realizations may rely on internal usage of HTTP-Headers. Information for processing requests and responses can be passed between components, that can have security implications.
For instance, this is commonly practices between a reverse proxy or TLS-offloader and an application server. Additional HTTP headers are used in such example to pass an original IP-address or client certificate.

Implementations MUST consider filtering both inbound and outbound traffic for HTTP-headers used internally.
Primary focus for inbound filtering is to prevent injection of malicious headers on requests.
For outbound filtering, the main concern is leaking of information.
