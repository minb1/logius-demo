##Recommendations

- One SHOULD use the [HTTP Protocol Binding for CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/http-protocol-binding.md). 
- There are no agreements to deviate from the standard in any part.
- Given the fact that many organizations still have little experience with standardized exchange of events, we recommend a useful relatively simple mechanism that consumers are already familiar with:
    - One SHOULD use structured content mode.
    - One SHOULD use the JSON (non batched) event format
    - When using structured mode one SHOULD NOT depend on the usage of HTTP-headers that replicate context-attributes in the event.    
- If the above advice is followed, when notifying via webhooks 1 message will contain JSON-structured data about 1 event that has occurred.
