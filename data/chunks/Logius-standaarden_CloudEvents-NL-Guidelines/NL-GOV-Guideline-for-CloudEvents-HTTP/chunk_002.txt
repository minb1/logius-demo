##Summary with points for attention 

- Events can be transferred with all standard or application-defined HTTP request methods that support payload body transfers. Events can be also be transferred in HTTP responses and with all HTTP status codes that permit payload body transfers.
- This specification defines three content modes for transferring events: 
    - structured (required): HTTP message body contains both event data and metadata attributes; an appropriate event format is used ((non-batching) JSON is the only event format that MUST be supported); 
    - batched (optional): HTTP message body contains event data and metadata attributes from multiple events; an appropriate event format is used.
    - binary (required): HTTP message body contains event data as-is; event attributes mapped to HTTP-headers; HTTP `Content-Type` header declares the media type.
 - Received `Content-Type` header value is:
    - `application/cloudevents(+xxxx)`: structured mode (`xxx` denotes the used event format)
    - `application/cloudevents-batch`: batched mode
    - Otherwise: binary mode (`Content-Type` header declares the media type.)
- Structured content mode:
    - The HTTP message body MUST contain both event data and metadata attributes.
    - The HTTP Content-Type header MUST be set to the media type of an event format (E.g. `application/cloudevents+json; charset=UTF-8`)
    - The chosen event format defines how all attributes, and data, are represented in the HTTP message body.
    - Implementations MAY include the same HTTP headers as defined for the binary mode (E.g. `ce-id`). 
- Batched content mode:
    - The HTTP message body MUST contain both event data and metadata attributes.
    - The HTTP Content-Type header MUST be set to the media type of an event format (E.g. `application/cloudevents-batch+json; charset=UTF-8`)
    - The chosen event format defines how a batch of events and all event attributes, and data, are represented.
    - All batched CloudEvents MUST have the same specversion attribute. Other attributes MAY differ, including the datacontenttype attribute. The batch MAY be empty.
- Binary content mode:
    - All CloudEvents context attributes, including extensions, MUST be mapped to HTTP headers with the same name as the attribute name but prefixed with `ce-`.
    - The value for each HTTP header is constructed as described in the [specification](
        https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/http-protocol-binding.md#3132-http-header-values)

At the moment there are *no additional agreements* about the use of the specification within the Dutch government.
