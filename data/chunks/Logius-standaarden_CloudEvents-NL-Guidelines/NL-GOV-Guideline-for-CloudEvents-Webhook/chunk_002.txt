The 'HTTP 1.1 Web Hooks for Event Delivery' specification prescribes rules constraining the use and handling of specific HTTP methods and headers and defines:
1. a HTTP method by how notifications are delivered by the sender

3. a registration handshake that protects the sender from being abused for flooding arbitrary HTTP sites with requests.
For each of the mechanisms it is described which agreements apply to both sender and receiver.
