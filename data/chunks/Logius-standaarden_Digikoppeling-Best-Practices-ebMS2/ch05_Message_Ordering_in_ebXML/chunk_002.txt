###MessageOrder Module**

> The MessageOrder module allows messages to be presented to the To Party in a particular order. This is accomplished through the use of the MessageOrder element. Reliable Messaging MUST be used when a MessageOrder element is present.
> MessageOrder module MUST only be used in conjunction with the ebXML Reliable Messaging Module (section 6) with a scheme of Once-And-Only-Once (sections 6.6). If a sequence is sent and one message fails to arrive at the To Party MSH, all subsequent messages will also fail to be presented to the To Party Application (see status attribute section 9.1.1).
