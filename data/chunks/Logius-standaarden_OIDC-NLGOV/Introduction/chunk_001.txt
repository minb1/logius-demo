#Introduction

Government regulations for permitting users (citizens and non-citizens) online access to government resources vary greatly from country to country. There is a strong desire to leverage federated authentication and identity services for public access to government resources online to enable the development of safe and innovative applications for e-government services, increase overall account security, reduce cost, and provide reliable identity assurances from established and trusted sources when applicable.

OpenID Connect is a protocol enabling such federated identity and authentication protocol. OpenID Connect supports a variety of Use Cases and offers a range of features and (security) options. This specification aims to define an OpenID Connect profile that provides Dutch governments with a foundation for securing federated access to public services online when applying OpenID Connect.
