#Flow

OpenID Connect Core specifies three paths via which authentication can be performed: the *Authorization Code Flow*, the *Implicit Flow* and the *Hybrid Flow*. The flows determine how the ID Token and Access Token are returned to the Client.

This profile requires that authentication is performed using the Authorization Code Flow, in where all tokens are returned from the Token Endpoint.

The Implicit Flow and Hybrid Flow allow tokens to be obtained from the Authorization Endpoint, and thereby omitting the Token endpoint. This  makes them vulnerable to token leakage and token replay and makes it impossible to cryptographically bind tokens to a certain Client.

Therefore, the Implicit Flow and Hybrid flow MUST NOT be used. Also, the IETF OAuth Working Group is removing support for the Implicit Flow from the OAuth 2.1 specification [[?OAuth2.1]] for the same reasons.
