#OpenID Provider profile

For OpenID Providers the following items are applicable:

- OpenID Providers MUST implement all *Mandatory to Implement Features for All OpenID Providers* (Section 15.1) and all *Mandatory to Implement Features for Dynamic OpenID Providers* (Section 15.2) of [[OpenID.Core]]. Note that these Mandatory to Implement features include required support for the Hybrid Flow for authentication (Response Types `id_token` and `id_token token`). This profile deviates from this requirement, as this profile specifically forbids the use of the Hybrid Flow (see also [Chapter 3](#flow)).
- OpenID Providers MUST support and require the use of 'Proof Key for Code Exchange' ([[RFC7636]]) using only the `S256` verification method and a code verifier with at least 43 and at most 128 cryptographically random characters to allow Clients to protect calls to the Token Endpoint.
- OpenID Providers MUST apply the necessary 'Cross-Origin Resource Sharing' ([[CORS]]) headers to allow browsers to protect requests to its endpoints and SHOULD NOT use wildcard origins.
- OpenID Providers that support Web Applications SHOULD follow the best practices specified in [[?OAuth2.Browser-Based-Apps]].
- OpenID Providers that support Native Applications MUST follow the best practices specified in OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps [[RFC8252]].
