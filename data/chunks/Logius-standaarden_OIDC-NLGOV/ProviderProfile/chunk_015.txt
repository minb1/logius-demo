###Discovery endpoint

All OpenID Providers are uniquely identified by a URL known as the `issuer` and MUST make a Discovery document in JSON format available at the path formed by concatenating `/.well-known/openid-configuration` to the `issuer` and SHOULD also make this Discovery document available at the path formed by concatenating `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` to the `issuer`. OpenID Providers MAY also publish their Discovery documents on other locations. All paths on which the Discovery document is published MUST use the `https` scheme.

> Note that for privacy considerations, only direct requests to the server metadata document SHOULD be used. The WebFinger method to locate the relevant OpenID Provider and its metadata, as described in [[OpenID.Discovery]] section 2, MUST NOT be supported.
