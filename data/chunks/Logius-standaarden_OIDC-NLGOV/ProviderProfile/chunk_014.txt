##Discovery

The OpenID Connect Discovery [[OpenID.Discovery]] standard provides a standard, programmatic way for Clients to obtain configuration details for communicating with OpenID Providers. Discovery is an important part of building scalable federation ecosystems.

OpenID Providers under this profile MUST publish their server metadata to help minimize configuration errors and support automation for scalable deployments.

- Exposing a Discovery endpoint does NOT inherently put the OpenID Provider at risk to attack. Endpoints and parameters specified in the Discovery document SHOULD be considered public information regardless of the existence of the Discovery document.
- Access to the Discovery document MAY be protected with existing web authentication methods if required by the OpenID Provider. Credentials for the Discovery document are then managed by the OpenID Provider. Support for these authentication methods is outside the scope of this profile.
- Endpoints described in the Discovery document MUST be secured in accordance with this profile and MAY have additional controls the Provider wishes to support.
