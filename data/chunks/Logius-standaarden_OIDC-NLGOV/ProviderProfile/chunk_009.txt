###Authentication Context

Whereas the iGov Assurance Profile for OpenID Connect [[OpenID.iGov]] recommends the use of Vectors of Trust (`vot`) to determine the amount of trust to be placed in digital transactions, using Authentication Context Class References (`acr`) instead is RECOMMENDED by this profile, due to their better alignment to the Levels of Assurance (LoA) defined by the `eIDAS` standards that are used in the European Union.

OpenID Providers SHOULD use eIDAS Level of Assurance (LoA) values for the `acr` Claim, but MAY use different values if eIDAS is not applicable. The eIDAS Level of Assurance values are defined as URIs in [[?eIDAS.SAML]], Section 3.2.

OpenID Providers MUST provide a Level of Assurance as `acr` value that is at least the requested Level of Assurance value requested by the Client (either via the `acr_values` or `claims` parameters) or - if none was requested - a Level of Assurance established through prior agreement.

OpenID Providers MUST NOT provide Authentication Methods References (`amr`), but MUST use Authentication Context Class References (`acr`) instead.

Clients MAY send an `vtr` (Vectors of Trust Request) parameter. If both the `vtr` and `acr_values` are in the request, the `acr_values` MUST take precedence and the `vtr` MUST be ignored.

> **Note:** Risk Based Authentication (RBA) should be an integral part of the LoA framework that is used by an OpenID Provider (the Identity Provider), such that the risk criteria for the resulting authentication are at least sufficient to meet the applicable LoA. That is, an OpenID Provider MAY apply RBA to require authentication methods with enhanced security or ease towards more user friendly methods when allowed by evaluated risk for an authentication, as long as the trust framework requirements are met. Selection of and criteria for any LoA framework are, however, situation specific and beyond the scope of this profile.
