##UserInfo Endpoint

OpenID Providers MUST support the UserInfo Endpoint and, at a minimum, the `sub` (subject) Claim. It is expected that the `sub` Claim will remain pseudonymous in Use Cases where obtaining personal information is not needed.

Support for a UserInfo Endpoint is important for maximum Client implementation interoperability even if no additional End-User information is returned. Clients are not required to call the UserInfo Endpoint, but SHOULD NOT receive an error if they do.

<aside class="example">
In an example transaction, the Client sends a request to the UserInfo Endpoint like the following:
<pre>
    GET /userinfo HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0MTg3MDI0MTIsIm

    Accept: application/json

    Connection: Keep-Alive
</pre>
And receives a document in response like the following:
<pre>
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2019 03:00:12 GMT
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

    {
       "sub": "6WZQPpnQxV",
       "iss": "https://idp-p.example.com",
       "given_name": "Stephen",
       "family_name": "Emeritus",
    }
</pre>
</aside>

OpenID Providers MUST support the generation of JWT encoded responses from the UserInfo Endpoint. Responding with unsigned JSON objects when neither signing nor encryption are requested by the Client as part of the `userinfo_signed_response_alg` and `userinfo_encrypted_response_alg` Client metadata parameters registered as part of Client Registration is OPTIONAL. Signed responses MUST be signed by the OpenID Provider's signing key, and encrypted responses MUST be encrypted with the authorized Client's public key. Please refer to [Algorithms](#algorithms) for more information on cryptographic algorithms and keys.
