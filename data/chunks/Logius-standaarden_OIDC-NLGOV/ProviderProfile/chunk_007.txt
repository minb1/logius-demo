###Pairwise Identifiers

Pairwise Subject Identifiers specified in OpenID Connect Core [[OpenID.Core]] Section 8 help protect an End-User's privacy by allowing an OpenID Provider to represent a single End-User with a different Subject Identifier (`sub`) for every Client the End-User connects to. This technique can help mitigate correlation of an End-User between multiple Clients and therewith tracking of End-Users between different sites and applications.

Use of pairwise identifiers does not prevent Clients from correlating data based on other identifying attributes such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, document numbers, or other attributes. However, since not all transactions require access to these attributes, but a Subject Identifier is always required, a pairwise identifier will aid in protecting the privacy of End-Users as they navigate the system.

OpenID Providers MUST support pairwise identifiers for cases where correlation of End-User's activities across Clients is not appropriate. OpenID Providers MAY support public identifiers for frameworks where public identifiers are required, or for cases where public identifiers are shared as attributes and the framework does not have a requirement for subject anonymity.

*Burgerservicenummers (BSN)*, *Rechtspersonen en Samenwerkingsverbanden Identificatienummers (RSIN)* and *Kamer van Koophandel (KvK) nummers* are considered public sectoral identifiers and therefore MUST NOT be used as Subject Identifiers in case correlation of End-User's activities across Clients is not appropriate. In such cases, the use of Polymorphic Pseudonyms or Polymorphic Identities is preferred.

> Note that BSNs MUST only be used by Relying Parties for Services eligible for using the BSN according to Dutch Law and that the BSN, or token containing it, SHOULD be encrypted.
