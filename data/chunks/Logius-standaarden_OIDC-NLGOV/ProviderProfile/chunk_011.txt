###Access Tokens

This profile requires an Access Token to be in JWT form. This is in line with the underlying NL GOV Assurance profile for OAuth 2.0 [[OAuth2.NLGov]].

Using a JWT formatted Access Token allows any OpenID Client to consume and verify a token without the need for introspection, thus reducing the dependency on an interaction with an external endpoint. As a result this may reduce load and availability requirements on the OpenID Provider. Furthermore, it provides a more uniform format over Access Token, ID Token, UserInfo response and Introspection response.

> Note that ID Tokens and UserInfo responses are primarily intended for the Client. The Access Token is primarily intended for consumption by a Resource Server. The Introspection response is intended for the requestor of an Introspection, which can be either a Client or Resource Server.
The Resource Server is typically not considered as an actor in OpenID Connect, but OpenID Providers will often act as Authorization Servers. In the case of Service Intermediation this is applicable by definition.
This profile does not directly place any constraints on the placement of Claims in various tokens or response messages. Claims may be placed in any of the four tokens/response messages, unless explicitly specified otherwise. This allows for maximum flexibility and interoperability.
