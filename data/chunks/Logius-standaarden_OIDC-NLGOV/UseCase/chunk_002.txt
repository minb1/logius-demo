##Representation

This profile supports several Use Cases for Representation Relationships, which apply when an End-User intends to consume an online service on behalf of a Natural or Juridical Person (the service consumer), where authentication and authorization is required. The End-User in these Use Cases is a Natural Person, representing the service consumer through a Representation Relationship. The relationship has to be formalized and may be either a direct relationship, either voluntarily or on legal grounds, or a chain of Representation Relationships. The formalization of these relationships is out of scope of this profile.

Example Representation Use Cases include voluntary authorization, representative assigned by court order (guardian, administrator), statutory signatory (director, president), limited authorized signatory, etc.
