###ID Tokens

All Clients MUST validate the signature of an ID Token before accepting it. Validation can be done using the public key of the issuing server, which is published in JSON Web Key (JWK) format. ID Tokens MAY be encrypted using the appropriate key of the requesting Client.

Clients MUST verify the following in received ID tokens:

`iss`

- The `issuer` Claim is the Uniform Resource Locater (URL) of the expected Issuer. Identical as in [[OpenID.iGov]].

`aud`

- The `audience` Claim contains the Client ID of the Client. Identical as in [[OpenID.iGov]].

`nonce`

- The `nonce` parameter in the ID Token MUST equal the `nonce` request parameter sent in the Authentication Request. This is in line with [[OpenID.Core]], Section 3.1.3.7.

`exp`, `iat`, `nbf`

- The `expiration`, `issued at`, and `not before` timestamps for the token are within acceptable ranges. These Claims are formatted as Unix Time Stamps (number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC). Values for `iat` and `nbf` MUST lie in the past and `exp` MUST lie in the future; the acceptable range for how far away `iat` is in the past is specific to the Client. This is in line with [[OpenID.iGov]].

`acr`

- The Level of Assurance received in the `acr` Claim is at least the Level of Assurance requested. See also [Section 5.2.3](#authentication-context). This is in line with [[OpenID.Core]], Section 3.1.3.7.

`represents`

- The `represents` Claim, if applicable, identifies the represented service consumer on behalf of which the End-User intends to authenticate. Any Client MUST be able to process `represents` Claims. As an exception, `represents` Claims MAY be ignored by the Client if, and only if, it is explicitly agreed upon beforehand that no Representation will be provided.
