###Web Applications

*Web applications* are applications that run on a web server and are consumed through the user-agent ("browser") by the End-User. Web applications are capable of securely authenticating themselves and of maintaining the confidentiality of secrets (e.g. Client credentials and tokens) and are therefore considered *confidential* Clients (OAuth 2.0 [[RFC6749]], Section 2.1).
