###Request Objects

Clients MAY optionally send requests to the Authorization Endpoint using the `request` or `request_uri` parameter as defined by OpenID Connect [[OpenID.Core]], section 6.
Passing a Request Object by reference using the `request_uri` is preferred because of browser limits and network latency.

Request Objects MUST be signed by the Client's registered key. Request Objects MAY be encrypted to the OpenID Provider's public key. When sending Request Objects by reference, Clients MUST pre-register `request_uri` values with the OpenID Provider at registration and MUST only use pre-registered values for `request_uri`.
