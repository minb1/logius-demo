###Browser-based Applications

*Browser-based applications* are applications that are dynamically downloaded and executed in a web browser that are also sometimes referred to as *user-agent-based applications* or *single-page applications*. Browser-based applications are considered to be not capable of maintaining the confidentiality of secrets, as they may be vulnerable to several types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and OAuth token theft. Browser-based applications are considered *public* Clients (OAuth 2.0 [[RFC6749]], Section 2.1).

- Browser-based applications SHOULD follow the best practices specified in [[?OAuth2.Browser-Based-Apps]].
