##Discovery

All Clients SHOULD use OpenID Provider discovery to avoid manual configuration and risk of mistakes.

Clients SHOULD acquire OpenID Provider metadata using either 'OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0' ([[OpenID.Discovery]] Section 4) or 'OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata' ([[RFC8414]] Section 3) via one of the Discovery endpoints provided by the OpenID Provider. See also Section [5.4](#discovery).

Clients SHOULD NOT use OpenID Provider Issuer Discover using WebFinger (as described in [[OpenID.Core]], Section 2) to avoid privacy issues such as leaking information to unknown locations.

Clients SHOULD follow caching directives provided by the OpenID Provider via HTTP headers [[RFC7234]] for the OpenID Provider's Discovery and `jwks` endpoints. This to avoid having to unnecessarily re-retrieve these documents while getting fresh updates of these documents when they have changed.

Clients SHOULD support `signed_metadata` as specified in [[RFC8414]] Section 2.1. In case signed metadata is available, this MUST be used over non-signed metadata and the signature MUST be verified prior to further utilizing any contents.

Clients MUST use the public keys obtained from the `jwks` endpoint to validate the signature on tokens or to encrypt Request Objects to the OpenID Provider.
