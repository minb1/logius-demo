###Authentication Response Validation

All Clients MUST validate the following in received Authentication Responses:

`state`

- The `state` response parameter MUST be present and MUST equal the `state` request parameter sent in the Authentication Request.

This in line with OpenID Connect Core ([[OpenID.Core]], Section 3.1.2.7), which equals to OAuth 2.0 ([[RFC6749]], Section 4.1.2 and 10.12). Verifying the `state` returned in the Authorization Response is part of CSRF mitigation measures and will help prevent attacks with late or stale responses, among others.
