###Native and Hybrid Applications

*Native applications* are applications installed and executed on the device used by the End-User (i.e. desktop applications, native mobile applications). Native applications can sufficiently protect dynamically issued secrets, but are not capable of maintaining the confidentiality of secrets that are statically included as part of an app distribution. Therefore, Native applications are considered *public* Clients, except when they are provisioned per-instance secrets via mechanisms like Dynamic Client Registration (OAuth 2.0 [[RFC6749]], Section 2.1).

*Hybrid applications* are applications implemented using web-based technology but distributed as a native app; these are considered equivalent to native applications for the purpose of this profile.

- Native applications MUST follow the best practices as specified in OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps [[RFC8252]].
- The use of *confidential* Native applications (which are provisioned per-instance secrets) is RECOMMENDED over *public* Native applications, as *confidential* Clients provide better means to perform secure Client Authentication.
- Native applications MUST use an external user-agent or "in-app browser tab" to make authorization requests; an "embedded user-agent" or "web-view" components MUST NOT be used for this purpose. See 'OAuth 2.0 for Native apps' [[RFC8252]] for more information on the "in-app browser tab" feature and support on various platforms.
