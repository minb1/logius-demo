##Scope Profiles

In the interests of data minimization balanced with the requirement to successfully identify the individual signing in to a service, the default OpenID Connect scope profiles to request Claims ([[OpenID.Core]] Section [5.4](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims)) may not be appropriate.

Matching of the identity assertion based on Claims to a local identifier or `account` related to the individual identity at a Level of Assurance is a requirement where the government in question is not able to provide a single identifier for all citizens based on an authoritative register of citizens.

The requirement for matching is also of importance where a cross-border or cross-jurisdiction authentication is required and therefore the availability of a single identifier (e.g. social security number) cannot be guaranteed for the individual wishing to authenticate.

However, in the Netherlands the BSN is, as a common identifier for citizens, available to BSN-eligible organizations. Nationwide interoperable pseudonyms per OpenID Client for non-BSN-eligible organizations exist as well.

The default `profile` scope of OpenID Connect is very wide, which is undesired from a privacy perspective. As such, the `profile` scope SHOULD NOT be used.

> Note that the `doc` profile described in the iGov profile for OpenID Connect [[OpenID.iGov]] is not in common use in the Netherlands and therefore not included in this profile.
