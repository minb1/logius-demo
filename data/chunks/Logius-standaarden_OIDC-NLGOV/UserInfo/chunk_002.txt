##Claim Interoperability

As per Section 5.1.2 of [[OpenID.Core]], Claim names SHOULD be collision-resistant. It is RECOMMENDED to use domain name based URIs as attribute names.

[[OpenID.Core]] Section 5.1 specifies a list of standard Claims. In a Dutch governmental context, attribute Claims are commonly registered in the BRP (_Basis Registratie Personen_, the Dutch citizen registry), as defined in [[?LO.GBA]]. Note that some of the standard Claims of OpenID Connect do not map directly or correctly with BRP attributes. BRP attributes SHOULD be prefered over OpenID Connect claims for attributes.
Additionally, usage of, or interoperability with, the ISA<sup>2</sup> core vocabularies is RECOMMENDED.
