##Claims Response

Response to a UserInfo request MUST match the scope and Claims requested to avoid having a OpenID Provider over-expose an End-User's identity information.
OpenID Providers MUST NOT provide any personal identifiable information without applicable consent.

Claims responses MAY also make use of the aggregated and/or distributed Claims structure to refer to the original source of the subject's Claims.
