##Claims Metadata

Claims Metadata (such as locale or the confidence level the OpenID Provider has in the Claim for the End-User) can be expressed as attributes within the UserInfo object, but are outside the scope of this document. These types of Claims are best described by the trust framework the Clients and OpenID Providers operate within.
It is up to the Client to assess the level of confidence provided by the OpenID Provider or the trust framework, per Claim. Expressing or evaluating such confidence is beyond the scope of this profile.

In order to provide a source, including integrity and optionally confidentiality, an OpenID Provider SHOULD be able to provide aggregated or support distributed Claims. The signee of such aggregated or distributed Claims implies the source and can support in assessing the level confidence or quality of the Claim.
