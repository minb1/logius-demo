##Claims Supported

Discovery requires including the `claims_supported` field, which defines the Claims a Client MAY expect to receive for the supported scopes. OpenID Providers MUST return Claims on a best effort basis. However, an OpenID Provider asserting it can provide an End-User Claim does not imply that this data is available for all its End-Users: Clients MUST be prepared to receive partial data.
OpenID Providers MAY return Claims outside of the `claims_supported` list, but they MUST still ensure that the extra Claims to not violate the privacy policies set out by the trust framework the Provider supports. The OpenID Provider MUST ensure to comply with applicable privacy legislation (e.g. informed consent as per GDPR) at all times.

> Note that when Representation is supported, the OpenID Provider MUST include `represents` in the list of supported Claims and MAY include nested Claims inside the `represents` Claim.
