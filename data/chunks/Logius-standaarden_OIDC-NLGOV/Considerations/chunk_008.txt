###Other features

The following overview lists RFC and BCP documents being drafted by the OAuth 2.0 working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and work-in-progress by the OpenID Foundation. Future updates to this profile are likely to seek usage of and interoperability with these specifications once finalized.

[[?OAuth2.JWT]]

- An RFC for Access Tokens in JWT format is being drafted in the OAuth 2.0 working group at IETF.

[[?OAuth2.JAR]]

- An RFC for Secured (signed and/or encrypted) Authorization Requests is being drafted in the OAuth 2.0 working group at IETF. Most of the practices described in this RFC are already part of the OpenID Connect Core specification.

[[?OAuth2.RAR]]

- An RFC that introduces a request parameter `authorization_details`, which allows for more expressive Authentication Requests than those possible with the `scope` parameter, is being drafted in the OAuth 2.0 working group at IETF.

[[?OAuth2.PAR]]

- An RFC that introduces an endpoint to which Clients can push Authorization Requests via a direct POST request to an Authorizaton Server, prior to forwarding the End-User with a `request_uri` referencing the request to the Authorization Server, is being drafted in the OAuth 2.0 working group at IETF. The practices described in this RFC are already part of the OpenID Connect Core specification.

[[?OAuth2.Security]]

- A Best Current Practice document that extends the OAuth 2.0 Security Threat Model and provides security recommendations to address security challenges in OAuth 2.0 is being drafted in the OAuth 2.0 working group at IETF.

[[?OAuth2.Browser-Based-Apps]]

- A Best Current Practice document that details security considerations and best practices to be taken into account when implementing browser-based applications that use OAuth 2.0 is being drafted in the OAuth 2.0 working group at IETF.

[[?OAuth2.1]]

- An effort to consolidate and simplify OAuth 2.0 by adding and removing functionality of the core OAuth 2.0 specification and by incorporating several RFCs and BCPs that were built upon OAuth 2.0.

[[?OpenID.Federation]]

- Work by the OpenID Foundation to support federations of OpenID Providers and relying Service Providers, by publishing aggregated metadata in a specified format.
