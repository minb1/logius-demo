###Federations

This profile acknowledges that federations are widely in use, in particular among (semi-)governmental and public domain orgranisations. However, no specific support or requirements for federations are included in this version of this profile.
The OpenID Foundation is currently drafting a specification for explicit support of federations using OpenID Connect. Future updates to this profile may adopt such federation specificaitons once finalized. See [Federation at the OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/tag/federation/).
