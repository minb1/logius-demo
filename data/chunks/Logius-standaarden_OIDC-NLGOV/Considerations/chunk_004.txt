Security of OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 is significantly based on the application of cryptography. Herein the choice of algorithms is important for both security as well as interoperability. This section lists relevant choices of algorithms for all messages and tokens.

For signing of messages and tokens, implementations:

- MUST support `RS256`.
- SHOULD support `PS256`; usage of `PS256` is RECOMMENDED over `RS256`.
- MAY support other algorithms, provided they are at least equally secure as `RS256`.
- MUST NOT support algorithms that are less secure than `RS256`.

For asymmetric encryption, in particular encryption of content encryption keys, implementations:

- MUST support `RSA-OAEP`.
- SHOULD support `RSA-OAEP-256`.
- MAY support other algorithms, provided they are at least equally secure as `RSA-OAEP`.
- MUST NOT support algorithms that are less secure than `RSA-OAEP`.

For symmetric encryption, implementations:

- MUST support `A256GCM`.
- MAY support other algorithms, provided they are at least equally secure as `A256GCM`.
- MUST NOT support algorithms that are less secure than `A256GCM`.

In addition to proper selection and configuration of algorithms, implementations MUST ensure to use a cryptographically secure (pseudo)random generator. Administrators and implementations MUST apply industry best practices for key management of cryptographic keys. This includes best practices for selection of applicable key length as applicable for the relevant algorithm(s) selected.
