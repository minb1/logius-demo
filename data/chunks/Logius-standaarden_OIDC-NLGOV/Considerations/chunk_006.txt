###Service Intermediation

One functionality that is widely used in the (semi-)governmental sector but is not included in the initial version of this profile specification is _Service Intermediation_. This scenario is sometimes also refered to as identity propagation.
Examples of Service Intermediation scenario's include portals, API aggregators and Clients with enhanched or automated assistence for consuming services.

Service Intermediation is applicable when the Service Provider does not directly interact with the End-User, but delegates this responsibility to a Service Intermediary. The Service Intermediary therefore interacts with the OpenID Provider for End-User authentication, with the service offered by the Serivce Provider in scope of the Authentication Request. The Service Provider can now rely on a token from the OpenID Provider received via the Service Intermediary. Note that there is interaction with OAuth2, the Service Provider acts as Resource Server.

Such a Service Intermediary can intermediate a single service offered by a single Service Provider (e.g. an accounting app (service) that has an option to submit a tax declaration) or it can aggregate multiple Services offered by multiple Service Providers using intermediation (e.g. an app that aggregates your health information stored at several health organisations).

It is anticipated that support for Service Intermediation will be added in a later version of this profile; when it will, the following should be considered:

- Service Intermediaries should be able to obtain Claims and subject identifiers for different intermediated Services via different interactions with the OpenID Provider, with End-User consent but without the need of complete re-authentication.
- Service Intermediaries are generally not allowed to access Claims and subject identifiers. Hence, the use of pairwise and encrypted subject identifiers and Claims is usually required.
- Service Providers control which Service Intermediaries they support, specifically when confidential information is involved. Hence, Client Registration with the OpenID Provider must be established such that Service Intermediaries can only intermediate (and request Claims and subject identifiers for) Services that they are authorized for. A potential solution direction could be the use of Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics, as described in [[RFC7800]].
