|| All profiles:<br> **Best effort**,<br>**Reliable Messaging**,<br>**End-to-End Security** |
|------------------|---|
| Which security profiles are used, and under what circumstances (for which Business Processes)? [Refer to Appendix C of Message Service Specification. May be partially captured by BPSS isConfidential, is Tamperproof, isAuthenticated definitions.] | Security profile 3 [ebMS 2.0] Appendix C]: “Sending MSH authenticates and both MSHs negotiate a secure channel to transmit data” **must be** applied. The HTTPS connection uses encryption to provide in transit confidentiality regarding the complete ebXML message and performs **both** certificate-based Client and Server authentication during the TLS handshake. | Security profile 8 [ebMS 2.0 Appendix C] **must be** used: “Sending MSH applies XML/DSIG structures to message and passes in a secure communications channel. Sending MSH applies XML/DSIG structures to send messagesand Receiving MSH returns a signed receipt.” Security profile 14 [ebMS 2.0 Appendix C] is **optional**: “Sending MSH applies XML/DSIG structures to message **and** applies confidentiality structures (XML-Encryption) and Receiving MSH returns a signed receipt”. |
