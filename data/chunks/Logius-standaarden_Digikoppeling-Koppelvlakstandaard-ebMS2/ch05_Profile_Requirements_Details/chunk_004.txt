| Are Roles defined for each party of each business process? List them, or provide a reference to the source of these values. Example – within the EAN•UCC system, approved values are specified by the EAN•UCC Message Service Implementation Guide. | Business process is out of scope for (this version of the) Digikoppeling. Within a single contract (CPA) between two Partners: - A Partner **must** fulfill one and only one role (a Partner cannot change its role within one contract). - A Partner can send messages (one or more) and/or receive messages (one or more). In case a Partner wants to use different roles, different contracts (CPA's) must be used. |
