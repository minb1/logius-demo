|Header elements:<br>`/SOAP:Header/eb:Signature`|||
| Is selective confidentiality of elements within an ebXML Message SOAP Header required? If so, how is this to be accomplished? [Not addressed by Messaging Specification 2.0.] | **Not applicable**.  | **Not applicable**. | Is payload confidentiality (encryption) required? [Yes, for Security Services Profiles 13, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22.] Which methods are allowed or required?   | **Not applicable**.  | Payload confidentiality is **optional**. [[[DK-beveiliging]]] describes what security standard must be used. |

| Notes  | Applications submitting data to, or receiving data from, Digikoppeling message handlers can perform encryption at the payload processing level. The ebXML Messaging protocol is payload-neutral and therefore supports transport of encrypted payloads. However, any encryption and decryption of payloads is out of scope for these profiles. |
