| Is a specific standard used for party identification? Provide details. Example - EAN•UCC Global Location Number. Ref.: ISO6523 - ICD0088. | Partners who are going to use ebMS for the first time **must** use an **OIN** (Organisatie Identificatie Nummer) for identification. Partners who are already using ebMS and are using other identification schemes are allowed to use their identification: the type attribute must identify their identification scheme and must be different from urn:osb:oin. The use of their own identification should be temporary: the partner should start using OIN at a certain moment for identification using Digikoppeling. For non-production environments a suffix is allowed after the OIN to distinguish it from production (e.g. “_OTA” or “_T”) <br><br> **OIN** stands for Organisatie Identificatie Nummer and is maintained by Logius in the *COR (Centrale OIN Raadpleegvoorziening)*. The number is unique and allows identification of partners, even if they are not themselves legal entities, but departments or units of larger organizations. <br><br> The OIN used for PartyId must be the same as the OIN from the end-party and should not contain the OIN from an intermediate party. In case the end-party is the same party that performs TLS, signing and/or encryption the OIN used for PartyId should be identical to the OIN used for the TLS-, signing- and/or encryption-certificate respectively. Hence, if the end-party does not perform TLS, signing and/or encryption the corresponding OIN’s may differ. |
| Should multiple PartyId elements be present in From and To elements? | (empty)  |
| Is the type attribute needed for each PartyId, and if so, what must it contain? Example – within the EAN•UCC system, the PartyId element and type are represented using Global Location Number.<span style='font-size:10pt'>`<eb:PartyId eb:type="http:/www.iso.int/schemas/eanucc/gln"/>1234567890128</eb:PartyId>`</span>| The type attribute **must** be present and **should** have the fixed value. <br>The following type attribute value has to be used in case of an OIN is used by the partner: **urn:osb:oin** |

|notes|ISO 6523 is an international standard registry of agencies issuing codes. Value 0106 in this registry identifies the Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry in the Netherlands. The prefix urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-cppa:PartyId-type is used to indicate the issuing agency is an ISO 6523 registered agency. The type attribute allows unique identification of the agency that issues the number or code that identifies the partner. In theory, this mechanism allows multiple identification systems to be used in parallel, with no requirement that the codes in those systems do not overlap.|
