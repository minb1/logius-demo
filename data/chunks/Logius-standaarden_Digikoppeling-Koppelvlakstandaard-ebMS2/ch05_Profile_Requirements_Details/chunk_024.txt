| Notes  |  Applications submitting data to, or receiving data from, Digikoppeling message handlers can perform timestamping. The ebXML Messaging protocol is payload-neutral and therefore supports timestamped payloads. However, this timestamping functionality is not part of the Digikoppeling functionality. Any valid ebXML Message must contain an eb:TimeStamp as part of the eb:MessageData. |
