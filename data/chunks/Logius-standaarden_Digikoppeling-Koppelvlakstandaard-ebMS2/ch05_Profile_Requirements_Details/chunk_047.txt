| What client behaviors should result when 3xx, 4xx or 5xx HTTP error codes are received? | In the event of an HTTP 5xx error code, the MSH **must** behave according to the recommendations specified in [[SOAP]]. An HTTP 503 error code **should** be treated as a recoverable error (i.e. **should not** terminate any reliable messaging retries). Codes in the 3xx and 4xx ranges **must** be interpreted as errors. |
