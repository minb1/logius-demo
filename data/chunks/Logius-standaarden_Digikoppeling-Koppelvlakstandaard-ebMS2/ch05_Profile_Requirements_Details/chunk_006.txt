|[[EBXML-MSG]] Section 3.1.3 ConversationId Element| All profiles:<br> **Best effort**,<br>**Reliable Messaging**,<br>**End-to-End Security** |
|------------------|---|
|Header elements|`/SOAP:Header/eb:MessageHeader/eb:ConversationId`|
| What is the user definition of a Conversation? What is the business criterion used to correlate messages considered parts of the same conversation?   | [EBXML-MSG] requires that request messages, response messages, and any acknowledgments and error messages have the same value for ConversationId. |
| In case the MSH implementation gives exposure of the ConversationId as it appears in the header, what identification scheme should be used for its value, and what format should it have? If it is a URI, how is it constructed? In case the ConversationId is not directly exposed, but only a handle that allows applications to associate messages to conversations, if the value of this handle is under control of the application, what format should it have? | No recommendation made.  |
 If BPSS is used, ConversationId typically maps to a business transaction. Is that the case? Does it map to a business collaboration instead? | No recommendation made. Business process is out of scope for Digikoppeling. |
| Test References |(empty) |  |
| Notes  | ConversationId is a required ebXML message header element. |
