#Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) or Spatial Reference System (SRS) is a framework to measure locations on the earth surface as coordinates. Geometries consist of coordinates. To be able to measure the geometry's coordinates on the earth surface a CRS is required in conjunction with the coordinates.

CRSs are uniquely identified by means of a Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID).
SRIDs may refer to different standards, for example EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset or Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

CRSs may be grouped into ensemble CRSs, e.g. ETRS89 (EPSG:4258). The CRSs that are part of an ensemble CRS are called ensemble member CRSs or member CRSs that realize a ensemble CRS, e.g ETRF2000 (EPSG:9067) is a member of and realizes the ETRS89 (EPSG:4258) ensemble. When exchanging geometry an ensemble member CRS shall be used instead of an ensemble CRS when known and if accurate data is required. When transforming geometry from one CRS to another, use an ensemble member CRS (instead of an ensemble CRS) as input and output of coordinate transformation, when known and if accurate data is required.

For a detailed description of CRSs see [[hr-crs]].

<aside class="note">In the geospatial module the abbreviation RD is used. RD refers to the "Stelsel van de Rijksdriehoeksmeting", this is the equivalent of EPSG code 28992 and EPSG name Amersfoort / RD New.</aside>
