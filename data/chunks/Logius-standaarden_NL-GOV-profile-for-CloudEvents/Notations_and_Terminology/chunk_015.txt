####Protocol Binding

A protocol binding describes how events are sent and received over a given
protocol.

Protocol bindings MAY choose to use an [Event Format](#event-format) to map an
event directly to the transport envelope body, or MAY provide additional
formatting and structure to the envelope. For example, a wrapper around a
structured-mode message might be used, or several messages could be batched
together into a transport envelope body.
