####Event Format

An Event Format specifies how to serialize a CloudEvent as a sequence of bytes.
Stand-alone event formats, such as the [JSON format](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/json-format.md), specify
serialization independent of any protocol or storage medium. Protocol Bindings
MAY define formats that are dependent on the protocol.
