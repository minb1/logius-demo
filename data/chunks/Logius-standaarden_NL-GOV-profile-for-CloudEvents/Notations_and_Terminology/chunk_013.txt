####Message

Events are transported from a source to a destination via messages.

A "structured-mode message" is one where the event is fully encoded using
a stand-alone event format and stored in the message body.

A "binary-mode message" is one where the event data is stored in the message
body, and event attributes are stored as part of message meta-data.
