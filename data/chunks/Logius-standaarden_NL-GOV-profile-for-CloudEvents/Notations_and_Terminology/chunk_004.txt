####Occurrence

An "occurrence" is the capture of a statement of fact during the operation of a
software system. This might occur because of a signal raised by the system or a
signal being observed by the system, because of a state change, because of a
timer elapsing, or any other noteworthy activity. For example, a device might go
into an alert state because the battery is low, or a virtual machine is about to
perform a scheduled reboot.
