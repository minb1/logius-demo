####Event

An "event" is a data record expressing an occurrence and its context. Events are
routed from an event producer (the source) to interested event consumers. The
routing can be performed based on information contained in the event, but an
event will not identify a specific routing destination. Events will contain two
types of information: the [Event Data](#event-data) representing the Occurrence
and [Context](#context) metadata providing contextual information about the
Occurrence. A single occurrence MAY result in more than one event.
