#####Integer

If the `sequencetype` is set to `Integer`, the `sequence` attribute has the
following semantics:

- The values of `sequence` are string-encoded signed 32-bit Integers.
- The sequence MUST start with a value of `1` and increase by `1` for each
  subsequent value (i.e. be contiguous and monotonically increasing).
- The sequence wraps around from 2,147,483,647 (2^31 -1) to -2,147,483,648
  (-2^31).
