#Context Attributes
<!-- ## [3.](#rfc.section.3) [Authorization Server Profile](#ServerProfile) -->

Every CloudEvent conforming to this specification MUST include context
attributes designated as REQUIRED, MAY include one or more OPTIONAL context
attributes and MAY include one or more extension attributes.

These attributes, while descriptive of the event, are designed such that they
can be serialized independent of the event data. This allows for them to be
inspected at the destination without having to deserialize the event data.
