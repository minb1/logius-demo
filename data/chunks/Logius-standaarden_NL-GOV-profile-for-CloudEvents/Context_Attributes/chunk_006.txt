- Constraints:
  - If an ID is available that can durable identify the event, producers SHOULD 
    use that ID. (for example so that consumers MAY use `id` to request information
    about the event from the source).
  - If no ID is available that can durable identify the event producers SHOULD use a random ID:
    - SHOULD use a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).
    - MUST describe the limitations (eg that it's just a random ID and no identification
      of the event occurred).
- Examples:
  - 'doc2021033441' (ID of the document created as a result of an event that occurred).
  - 'f3dce042-cd6e-4977-844d-05be8dce7cea' (UUID generated with the sole function of 
    being able to uniquely identify the event.
