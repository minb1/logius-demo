##Sequence

This extension defines two attributes that can be included within a CloudEvent to describe the position of an event in the ordered sequence of events produced by a unique event source.
The `sequence` attribute represents the value of this event's order in the stream of events. The exact value and meaning of this attribute is defined by the `sequencetype` attribute. If the `sequencetype` is missing, or not defined in this specification, event consumers will need to have some out-of-band communication with the event producer to understand how to interpret the value
of the attribute.
