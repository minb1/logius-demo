###specversion

- Type: `String`
- Description: The version of the CloudEvents specification which the event
  uses. This enables the interpretation of the context. Compliant event
  producers MUST use a value of `1.0` when referring to this version of the
  specification.

  Currently, this attribute will only have the 'major' and 'minor' version
  numbers included in it. This allows for 'patch' changes to the specification
  to be made without changing this property's value in the serialization.
  Note: for 'release candidate' releases a suffix might be used for testing
  purposes.

- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be a non-empty string
