####CloudEvents-NL

- Two of the extension attributes included by CloudEvents ('dataref' and 
  'sequence') are included as optional attributes in the CloudEvents-NL profile 
  because it is foreseen that there is often a need to use these attributes.
- Extension attributes should be kept minimal to ensure the CloudEvent can be 
  properly serialized and transported (e.g. when using HTTP-headers most HTTP 
  servers will reject requests with excessive HTTP header data).
