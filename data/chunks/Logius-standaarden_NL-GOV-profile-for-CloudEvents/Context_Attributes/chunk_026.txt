####Example

The following example shows a CloudEvent in which the event producer has included
both `data` and `dataref` (serialized as JSON):

```JSON
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "com.github.pull_request.opened",
    "source" : "https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull/123",
    "id" : "A234-1234-1234",
    "datacontenttype" : "text/xml",
    "data" : "<much wow=\"xml\"/>",
    "dataref" : "https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull/123/events/A234-1234-1234.xml"
}
```
