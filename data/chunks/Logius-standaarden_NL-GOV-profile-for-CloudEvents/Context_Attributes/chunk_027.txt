- MAY be used to reference an external data location (for example: a link back to 
  the producer of the event that can be queried for more information about the event).
- MAY be used to implenment 'informatiearm notificeren' where the consumer of the 
  event receives some minimal information on the nature of the event, but then has 
  to issue a request back to the producer to obtain additional information (the time 
  aspect may deserve attention because changes may occur in the period that consumers
  are notified and the time of requesting additional information).
