##Attribute Naming Convention

The CloudEvents specifications define mappings to various protocols and
encodings, and the accompanying CloudEvents SDK targets various runtimes and
languages. Some of these treat metadata elements as case-sensitive while others
do not, and a single CloudEvent might be routed via multiple hops that involve a
mix of protocols, encodings, and runtimes. Therefore, this specification limits
the available character set of all attributes such that case-sensitivity issues
or clashes with the permissible character set for identifiers in common
languages are prevented.

CloudEvents attribute names MUST consist of lower-case letters ('a' to 'z') or
digits ('0' to '9') from the ASCII character set. Attribute names SHOULD be
descriptive and terse and SHOULD NOT exceed 20 characters in length.
