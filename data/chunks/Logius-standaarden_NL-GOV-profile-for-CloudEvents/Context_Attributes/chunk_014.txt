###datacontenttype

- Type: `String` per [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046)
- Description: Content type of `data` value. This attribute enables `data` to
  carry any type of content, whereby format and encoding might differ from that
  of the chosen event format. For example, an event rendered using the
  [JSON envelope](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/json-format.md#3-envelope) format might carry an XML payload
  in `data`, and the consumer is informed by this attribute being set to
  "application/xml". The rules for how `data` content is rendered for different
  `datacontenttype` values are defined in the event format specifications; for
  example, the JSON event format defines the relationship in
  [section 3.1](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/json-format.md#31-handling-of-data).

  For some binary mode protocol bindings, this field is directly mapped to the
  respective protocol's content-type metadata property. Normative rules for the
  binary mode and the content-type metadata mapping can be found in the
  respective protocol

  In some event formats the `datacontenttype` attribute MAY be omitted. For
  example, if a JSON format event has no `datacontenttype` attribute, then it is
  implied that the `data` is a JSON value conforming to the "application/json"
  media type. In other words: a JSON-format event with no `datacontenttype` is
  exactly equivalent to one with `datacontenttype="application/json"`.

  When translating an event message with no `datacontenttype` attribute to a
  different format or protocol binding, the target `datacontenttype` SHOULD be
  set explicitly to the implied `datacontenttype` of the source.

- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - If present, MUST adhere to the format specified in
    [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046)
