###subject

- Type: `String`
- Description: This describes the subject of the event in the context of the
  event producer (identified by `source`). In publish-subscribe scenarios, a
  subscriber will typically subscribe to events emitted by a `source`, but the
  `source` identifier alone might not be sufficient as a qualifier for any
  specific event if the `source` context has internal sub-structure.

  Identifying the subject of the event in context metadata (opposed to only in
  the `data` payload) is particularly helpful in generic subscription filtering
  scenarios where middleware is unable to interpret the `data` content. In the
  above example, the subscriber might only be interested in blobs with names
  ending with '.jpg' or '.jpeg' and the `subject` attribute allows for
  constructing a simple and efficient string-suffix filter for that subset of
  events.

- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - If present, MUST be a non-empty string
- Example:
  - A subscriber might register interest for when new blobs are created inside a
    blob-storage container. In this case, the event `source` identifies the
    subscription scope (storage container), the `type` identifies the "blob
    created" event, and the `id` uniquely identifies the event instance to
    distinguish separate occurrences of a same-named blob having been created;
    the name of the newly created blob is carried in `subject`:
    - `source: https://example.com/storage/tenant/container`
    - `subject: mynewfile.jpg`
