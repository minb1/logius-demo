- The time the event was logged SHOULD be used (in many cases this is the only 
  time that can be determined unambiguously).
- The exact meaning of `time` MUST be clearly documented.
- The time when an event occurred in reality SHOULD NOT be used (if there is a need for this 
  among consumers, this can be included in payload data).
- If the time when an event occurred in reality is needed for things like 
  routing or filtering, it can be included as a context attribute by the producer.
