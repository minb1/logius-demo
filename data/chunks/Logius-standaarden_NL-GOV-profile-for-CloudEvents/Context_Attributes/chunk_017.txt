####CloudEvents-NL

Constraints:
- It SHOULD be prevented that different schedules arise for the same data.
- The dataschema attribute is expected to be informational, largely to be used 
  during development and by tooling that is able to provide diagnostic information 
  over arbitrary CloudEvents with a data content type understood by that tooling 
  (see: [The role of the dataschema attribute within versioning](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/primer.md#the-role-of-the-dataschema-attribute-within-versioning)
