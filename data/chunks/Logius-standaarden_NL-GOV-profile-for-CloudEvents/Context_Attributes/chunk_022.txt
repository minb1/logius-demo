###Extension Context Attributes

A CloudEvent MAY include any number of additional context attributes with
distinct names, known as "extension attributes". Extension attributes MUST
follow the same [naming convention](#attribute-naming-convention) and use the
same [type system](#type-system) as standard attributes. Extension attributes
have no defined meaning in this specification, they allow external systems to
attach metadata to an event, much like HTTP custom headers.

Extension attributes are always serialized according to binding rules like
standard attributes. However this specification does not prevent an extension
from copying event attribute values to other parts of a message, in order to
interact with non-CloudEvents systems that also process the message. Extension
specifications that do this SHOULD specify how receivers are to interpret
messages if the copied values differ from the cloud-event serialized values.
