###time

- Type: `Timestamp`
- Description: Timestamp of when the occurrence happened. If the time of the
  occurrence cannot be determined then this attribute MAY be set to some other
  time (such as the current time) by the CloudEvents producer, however all
  producers for the same `source` MUST be consistent in this respect. In other
  words, either they all use the actual time of the occurrence or they all use
  the same algorithm to determine the value used.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - If present, MUST adhere to the format specified in
    [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)
