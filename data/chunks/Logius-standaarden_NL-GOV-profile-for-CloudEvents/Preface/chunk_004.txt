Introduction
The basic pattern for use cases describes a (public/governmental) application in the role of '[producer](#producer)' publishes '[events](#event)': data records expressing an occurrence and its context. Published events can be consumed by applications in the role of '[consumer](#consumer)'. Consumers are subscribed to receiving certain types of events. There may or may not be one or more applications in the rol of '[intermediary](#intermediary)' that take care of routing events to consumers based on contextual information. The basic pattern used here is the [publish-subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern).

Within this context, it concerns standardization of the automated exchange of event information via applications. In practice, agreements at business level are often also required between the parties involved. 

A number of [use cases](use-cases) have been described that clarify the use of the GOV NL profile.
